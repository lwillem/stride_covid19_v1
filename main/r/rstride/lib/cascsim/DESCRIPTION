Description: It is an open source insurance claim simulation engine sponsored
    by the Casualty Actuarial Society. It generates individual insurance claims 
	including open claims, reopened claims, incurred but not reported claims 
	and future claims. It also includes claim data fitting functions to help set 
	simulation assumptions. It is useful for claim level reserving analysis.
