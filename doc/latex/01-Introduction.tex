This manual provides a brief description of the Stride software and its
features. 
Stride stands for \textbf{S}imulation of \textbf{tr}ansmission 
 of \textbf{i}nfectious \textbf{d}is\textbf{e}ases. It is an agent-based modeling 
system for close-contact infectious disease outbreaks developed by researchers at the
University of Antwerp and Hasselt University, Belgium.
The simulator uses census-based synthetic populations
that capture the demographic and geographic distributions, as well as detailed social networks.

Stride is an open source software. License information can be found in the project root directory in the file \texttt{LICENSE.txt}. The authors hope to make large-scale
agent-based epidemic models more useful to the community.

More info on the project and results obtained with the software
can be found in

Please note that a lot of functionality has been improved, extended and added since those publications.
